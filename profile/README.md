Welcome to the official GitHub organization of the development team of the Challenge List! Here, we're creating a modern format and approach to Geometry Dash Listing websites, and all of our progress will be posted in each respective repository. Our old backend will not be open-sourced, as it is meant to be private and proprietary and is full of older code that will be subsided and eventually replaced with the current iteration in development.
<br />
<h3>Current Repositories</h3>
<h6>
<a href="https://github.com/challengelist/api">challengelist/api</a> - The backend workings of the website, home to all individual components that make the website run in the background.
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/challengelist/website">challengelist/website</a> - The current implementation of the website, built to fit modern conventions and standards surrounding the rest of the modern web.
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/challengelist/queue-processor">challengelist/queue-processor</a> - An advanced processor that works over Redis to handle and permeate large amounts of data on a vast spectrum.
